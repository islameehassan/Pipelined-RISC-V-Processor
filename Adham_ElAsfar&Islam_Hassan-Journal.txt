=> We worked on the Project collaboratively using github and zoom (when necessarry)


November 2, 10:05PM: Finished the Control unit table for the 40 instructions.
		     Finished the ALU Control unit table.

November 3, 11:43AM: Updated the Control unit module to fit the 40 instructions.
		     Updated the ALU Control unit module.

November 3, 05:31PM: Created the Halting unit module.
		     Created the Shifter module used in the ALU.
		     Handled some Errors in the Control unit and ALU Control Unit modules.

November 3, 10:54PM: Created the Branching unit module.

November 4, 00:59AM: Added some definitions to the define.v file.
		     Updated the Data Memory module to be Byte-addressable instead of Word-addressable.

November 4, 11:15AM: Created a separate Test Bench for the Data Memory module.
		     Handleded some erros in the Data Memory module.

November 4, 02:45PM: Integratred the Branching and Halting unit modules with the Datapath to handle 		     branching and jumping.
		     
November 4, 03:40PM: Updated the Datapath and Immediate Generator modules to work together without 		     the need for the shift left by 1-bit register used in the old design.

November 4, 06:29PM: Created the program to generate randome test cases using C++.

November 4, 10:04PM: Tested the 40 instructions using test cases from the generator and corrected 		     some errors to ensure everything is working.

November 5, 07:16PM: Created the Block Diagram for the Processor using an online diagram tool.

November 5, 07:35PM: Finished the report for the Project.

November 5, 10:13PM: Created and finished the Readme.txt file.
