This Program implements the 40 instructions of the RISC-V32 Processor.
The 40 instructions have been tested and validated using 3 test cases.
Assuming that all the branch instructions do not use labels, instead, they use the immediate value equivalent to the number of instructions to be skipped if the branching happens
