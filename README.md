# Pipelined-RISC-V-Processor
This project is co-work between Ahmed Jaheen, Adhem El-Asfar, and Islam Hassan as part of the Computer Architecture course at 
the American University in Cairo. The project aims to build a fully pipelined RISC-V processor using Verilog.

The processor is fully pipelined and handles all types of hazards correctly while working with a single memory for reading and writing.
It supports the 40 RV-32I instructions in addition to RV-32M instructions. Other features include moving the branching decision and address computation to the ID stage while handling all the resulting hazards correctly. For more information about the implementation and the block diagram, refer to the technical report.
